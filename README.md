## üìò Learning Levels with Adhyay-1  

The **Adhyay-1 Development Kit** is structured into 3 progressive levels ‚Äî **Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced** ‚Äî so that learners can grow step by step from simple electronics to advanced robotics and TinyML projects.  


### üîπ Level 1 ‚Äì Basic  
**Focus:** Single-component interfacing and fundamentals.  

- Learn basics of microcontrollers.
- Control outputs ‚Üí LEDs, buzzer, motors, switches etc.  
- Work with individual sensors: Ultrasonic, IR, LDR, DHT11, IMU etc.  
- Display sensor readings on Serial Monitor / OLED.  


### üîπ Level 2 ‚Äì Intermediate  
**Focus:** Combining multiple sensors and actuators for functional projects.  

- Control **two or more devices together** (e.g., motor + sensor).  
- Understand **sensor fusion**, decision-making from multiple inputs.  
- Explore Remote control projects.  


### üîπ Level 3 ‚Äì Advanced  
**Focus:** Robotics, AI, and TinyML-based major projects.  

- Implement **TinyML** models.  
- Build **gesture recognition** with ML.  
- Develop predictive IoT applications.  
- Create advanced robotics integrating multiple modules.
