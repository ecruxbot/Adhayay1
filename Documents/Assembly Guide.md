## ü§ñ Robot Assembly Guide  

The Adhyay-1 Kit comes with a **partially assembled robot base**, including:  
- Metal/Plastic **chassis**  
- Two **DC motors** with **wheels & brackets**  
- **Caster wheel** for balance  
- **Adhyay-1 Expansion Board (Main PCB)** pre-mounted  

Learners can then expand and assemble the complete robot with sensors and modules using the following steps:

### üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Assembly  

1. **Servo Motor**  
   - Fix the servo motor on the front/top side of the chassis.  
   - This is used for rotating the ultrasonic sensor or OLED for scanning.  

2. **Ultrasonic Sensors (x3)**  
   - Mount one ultrasonic sensor at the front center (‚Äúeyes‚Äù of the robot).  
   - Place two more at the left and right side (for side obstacle detection).  

3. **5-Channel IR Array (Line Following Sensor)**  
   - Mount the IR array at the bottom front, facing the ground.  
   - Ensure the sensors are close to the floor but not touching it.  

4. **OLED Display (on Servo)**  
   - Attach the OLED display on top of the servo motor.  
   - This allows dynamic rotation and better visibility during demos.  
   - IMU (MPU6050) ‚Üí fix flat at the center for accurate orientation.  

5. **Other Sensors (Optional)**  
   - LDR Sensor ‚Üí place on top/side where light falls easily.  
   - DHT11 Sensor ‚Üí place in open airflow for accurate readings.  
   - TSOP Module ‚Üí mount on front/top for IR remote reception.  
   
6. **Outputs & Communication**  
   - Mount the buzzer/speaker on the side with a small hole for clear sound.  
   - Connect the Bluetooth module to the board and place on the side.  

7. **Wiring & Power**  
   - Connect each sensor and actuator to its labeled header on the Adhyay-1 Expansion Board.  
   - Secure wires using zip ties for neat assembly.  
   - Fix the 12V battery with Velcro or holder, keeping charger port accessible.  

8. **Final Check**  
   - Ensure wheels rotate freely.  
   - Verify all sensors/modules are tightly secured.  
   - Double-check wiring before switching ON.
